It sounds like you want to dynamically display the information submitted by users in the form on another page (product page) of your e-commerce web app. To achieve this, you'll need to follow a process that involves storing the user-submitted data, retrieving it on the product page, and dynamically populating the relevant HTML elements with the retrieved data.

Here's a basic example using HTML, JavaScript, and PHP:

Form Page (form.html):
html
Copy code
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Product Submission Form</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h2>Product Submission Form</h2>
    <form action="process_form.php" method="post">
        <label for="productName">Product Name:</label>
        <input type="text" id="productName" name="productName" required><br>

        <label for="productDescription">Product Description:</label>
        <textarea id="productDescription" name="productDescription" required></textarea><br>

        <!-- Add more input fields for other product details such as images, price, etc. -->

        <input type="submit" value="Submit">
    </form>
</body>
</html>
Processing Form Data (process_form.php):
php
Copy code
<?php
if ($_SERVER["REQUEST_METHOD"] == "POST") {
    // Get form data
    $productName = $_POST["productName"];
    $productDescription = $_POST["productDescription"];
    // Retrieve other form data as needed

    // Store data in a session variable (you may use a database in a real-world scenario)
    session_start();
    $_SESSION["productData"] = [
        "productName" => $productName,
        "productDescription" => $productDescription,
        // Add other data here
    ];

    // Redirect to the product page
    header("Location: product_page.php");
    exit();
}
?>
Product Page (product_page.php):
php
Copy code
<?php
session_start();

// Retrieve product data from the session variable
$productData = $_SESSION["productData"];

// Check if data is available before trying to display it
if ($productData) {
    $productName = $productData["productName"];
    $productDescription = $productData["productDescription"];
    // Retrieve other data as needed
} else {
    // Redirect back to the form if no data is found
    header("Location: form.html");
    exit();
}
?>

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title><?php echo $productName; ?> - Product Page</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h2><?php echo $productName; ?></h2>
    <p><?php echo $productDescription; ?></p>
    <!-- Add other HTML elements to display additional product details -->
</body>
</html>
This example uses PHP sessions to temporarily store the form data between the form submission and the display on the product page. In a real-world scenario, you might want to use a database to store and retrieve this data securely. Additionally, you can enhance the product page with more HTML elements to display other details submitted by the user.

Sure, you can modify the product_page.php to include the product image, name, and price in the product card. Make sure to adjust the code according to your actual data structure and requirements. Here's an example:

php
Copy code
<?php
session_start();

// Retrieve product data from the session variable
$productData = $_SESSION["productData"];

// Check if data is available before trying to display it
if ($productData) {
    $productName = $productData["productName"];
    $productDescription = $productData["productDescription"];
    // Retrieve other data as needed
} else {
    // Redirect back to the form if no data is found
    header("Location: form.html");
    exit();
}
?>

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title><?php echo $productName; ?> - Product Page</title>
</head>
<body>
    <div class="product-card">
        <div class="product-image">
            <!-- Display the product image -->
            <img src="path/to/your/images/<?php echo $productName; ?>.jpg" alt="<?php echo $productName; ?>">
        </div>
        <div class="product-details">
            <!-- Display the product name -->
            <p class="product-name"><?php echo $productName; ?></p>
            <!-- Display the product description -->
            <p class="product-description"><?php echo $productDescription; ?></p>
            <!-- Add other HTML elements to display additional product details like price -->
            <!-- You may want to add more data to your $productData array in process_form.php -->
            <p class="product-price">$19.99</p>
        </div>
    </div>
</body>
</html>
In this example, I assumed that your product images are stored in a directory named "images" with filenames matching the product names (e.g., "product1.jpg"). Adjust the src attribute of the img tag accordingly based on your file structure.

Also, note that the price in this example is hardcoded as "$19.99". You should replace this with the actual price information from your product data. If you're collecting the price in your form, make sure to retrieve and display it appropriately.
